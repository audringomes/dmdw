The extensive use of css styles enables customisation. See <a href=\"dmdw_css.html\" class=\"topiclink\">CSS<\/a>.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">All html elements referring to a collection, field, enumerator or topology rule have unique identifiers in the output, based on the internal names. These are used for cross references.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">Note that the html isn\'t responsive. It is supposed to be viewed at a desktop.<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\r"
